# TinDog: A samply start-up webpage

This site is deployed here: https://angela-ding.github.io/start-up-website/

This is a sample start-up webpage made using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4.
This is strictly in front-end.

## What I learned:
* Using HTML and CSS to create the webpage layout and styling
* Using Bootstrap 4 to create animations, scrollable lists, and more
* Understood more about the CSS Box Model
